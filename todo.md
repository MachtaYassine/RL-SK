when shared_networks is active add a new flag --sub_episodes. Where instead of playing a full game in SkullKingEnv, at each episode, a round number is geerated from 1, to 10, a number of players is generated from 3 to 8, a total score in some arbitrary range depending on the round number and play a  normal round !
